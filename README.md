# Latest updates
- This has been updated to **Directus 11.9**
- **Create snapshots with a single command:** cd scripts && pnpm create-snapshot
- **Extension folder updates:** We've updated the extension folders to match the recommended structure. This ensures that you can load your downloaded and custom extensions correctly. Remember to commit the dist folder and package.json for custom extensions. We've included a custom extension as an example.
- **Automatic schema synchronization:** Run cd scripts && pnpm create-snapshot to create a snapshot of your working schema from your local development environment. Then, push your changes into your branch for deployment, and it will be synced to your Railway environment.
- **Environment variable management:** We've added a .env.example file(duplicate and rename to .env) to manage your environment variables and secrets. Docker Compose will use this file to load the environment variables.

# Directus railway template

This example runs a [Directus](https://directus.io/) instance with minimal config using PostGIS.

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- Click the Deploy on Railway button
- Let railway deploy your service, most of the configurations have been preset, but feel free to tweak them as you like before deployment.
- Login in the admin panel using the defined ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD.
- Use of S3 is a must in this template.
- For local development, just run `docker compose up` or run the same command twice (Sometimes, the Directus container starts before other containers are ready, resulting in a failure upon startup).
